### What is npm and npx?

- `npm` and `npx` are nothing but js file located at : `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node_modules\npm\bin` with the name `npm-cli.js` and `npx-cli.js` that is executed when run `npm` and `npx` .

- if we want we can modify it's files like creating `alias` of our choice lin `mynpm` and `mynpx` instead of default name `npm` and `npx` just for fun purpose.

- We can also modify the files of `vite` or `crate-vite` or any other cli packages .
