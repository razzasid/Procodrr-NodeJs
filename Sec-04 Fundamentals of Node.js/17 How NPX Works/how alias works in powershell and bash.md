In **bash**, you can create an alias for file paths or any commands, including `.exe` easily, like:

### ✅ Example in Bash:

```bash
alias open-discord='/c/Users/hameed/AppData/Local/Discord/app-1.0.9191/Discord.exe'
```

But in **PowerShell**, aliases only work for commands or functions, not direct file paths. For paths, you’d use functions or variables instead. Want me to show you how?

📝 Just remember to run `source ~/.bashrc` after editing.
