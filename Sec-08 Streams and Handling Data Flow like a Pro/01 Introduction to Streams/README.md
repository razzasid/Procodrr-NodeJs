## 📚 Introduction to Streams in Node.js

---

### 🔹 What is a Stream?

* A **Stream** is a way to **handle data in chunks**, instead of loading the entire data at once.
* Useful when working with **large files**, **network data**, or **real-time inputs**.

---

### 🧠 Why Streams?

* Efficient memory usage
* Handles large data smoothly
* Speeds up data processing (process as it comes)

### 🧪 Real-Life Example:

**Zipline in a village**:
Instead of carrying a 10 GiB file all at once, send it piece-by-piece like a zipline delivering packets.
Each small piece = **a data chunk**
