## Base64 Encoding

Base64 is a character encoding that takes binary data and converts it to string/text. 

It has total 64 characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, /, +).

It use 6 bits only, and called as the subset of ASCII

In browser we have few methods, 

- atob() ASCII to Binary

- btoa() Binary to ASCII

These methods had limitation, we can only pass string not actual binary data.

It converts the given string to binary(utf-8) and binary to base64 and vice versa for other method.

For base64 to work it need at least 3 Byte of data, else it will add multiple zeros to fill the gap. And zeros Byte(8 Bit) will be replaced by =
