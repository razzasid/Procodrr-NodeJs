## Writing Multi Byte Data

- .setInt8() has limitation to 255 (8 Bits only)

- .setInt16() can store larger numbers (16 bits)



we can also pass 3rd argument of Endianness, by default it is LE

(true for BE) Only comes with multi-byte (16 and 32)


- .getInt16(index, ?Endian)


we also have methods for 32 Bits.
